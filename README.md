Folder contains Cara's code for reading in excel files created by Avasoft8 in the multichannel optical spectrometer in the lab.

Info for Shreya:
    - I put the code you need to look at the files in a jupyter notebook you should be able to open.
    - In order to run this you will want to be in the environment I attached in environment.yml file.
    - Info on how to do this can be found here --> (https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment)
